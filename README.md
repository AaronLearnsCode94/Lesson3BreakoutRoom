*Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?*

Shopify has been an extremely succesful startup created by Tobias Lutke and Scott Lake as they were dissapointed with the current range of e-commerce products available on the market at the time.

The company has excelled within the sapce due to its ease of accessibility allowing customers to open an online store in a few clicks by utilising its online store builder.

By using cloud technology Shopify bears the responsibility of maintaining the technicial and security matters and allowed its merchants to focus on their online storefront.

However extreme success does not come without its fair share of challenges, from issues regarding stability, speed and reliability for its users Shopify also faces issues regarding future development and fierce competion in the online market place. Particular competitors would include Amazon and marketplaces online such as Etsy.

Why are they considered a FinTech company?

At its heart, Shopify acts as a website builder. This anchor tool that Shopify is centered around offers a graphic user interface (GUI)-driven way of building a website. No additional coding knowledge is necessary. Websites that are built using the Shopify site builder are also hosted on their web servers. To complete the roundup, Shopify has add-on applications that help eCommerce sites work. This gives them additional functionality needed, such as payment processing, inventory management, shopping cart features, handling of shipping, and more. 
Shopify is the epitome of the embedded finance theory thatâ€™s been all the rage over the last year and a half in fintech.
